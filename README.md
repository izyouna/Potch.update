## ⚡️ Download & Quick Install

### Method 1: One-Line Terminal Installer (Recommended — Fast & Automatic) 🚀

Open **Terminal** on your Mac, paste the following command, and press **Enter**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/izyouna/Potch.update/main/install.sh | bash
```

> ✨ **What this does:** Automatically downloads the latest release, installs it directly to `/Applications`, **bypasses macOS Gatekeeper quarantine**, and launches Potch instantly in under 5 seconds — no manual permission clicks required.

---

### Method 2: Standard Disk Image (.dmg) 💿

| Format | Download Link | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Apple Disk Image** | [**📥 Download Potch.dmg**](https://github.com/izyouna/Potch.update/raw/main/Potch.dmg) | ~15 MB | Standard macOS disk installer with drag-to-Applications |

#### Installation Steps:
1. Download [**`Potch.dmg`**](https://github.com/izyouna/Potch.update/raw/main/Potch.dmg) and open it.
2. Drag **`Potch`** into your **`Applications`** folder.
3. Open Potch. If macOS displays *"Apple could not verify “Potch” is free of malware..."*:
   - **Method A (System Settings — No Terminal):** Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**, scroll down to **Security**, and click **"Open Anyway"**.
   - **Method B (Instant 1-second fix in Terminal):**
     ```bash
     xattr -cr /Applications/Potch.app
     ```
   *(Note: This happens on macOS Sequoia because Potch is independently developed and not yet notarized with a $99/yr Apple certificate. Once opened the first time, it will never ask again.)*

## 🔄 Automatic In-App Updates

> 💡 **All install methods receive 100% automatic in-app updates.**  
> Whether installed via the **Terminal Script** or **`Potch.dmg`**, Potch connects to the built-in [Sparkle Auto-Update](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/izyouna/Potch.update/main/appcast.xml) system in the background. Whenever a new release or hotfix is published, the app downloads and installs updates seamlessly on its own — **you never need to manually download new disk images.**
